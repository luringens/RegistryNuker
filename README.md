# RegistryNuker
A small C# console application for quickly travling the Registry to delete keys or values containing an unwanted string. 
Made because an application refused to reinstalled because of hundreds of leftover registry keys from the bad uninstaller.

The console will ask if you want to serach through CURRENT_USER or LOCAL_Machine, and if you want to print matches, just delete all matches, or ask for confirmation for each one.
